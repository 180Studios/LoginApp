# Login App

Originally developed for 180 Studios in Santa Rosa, CA, this Python app was developed to fit a need of a free, simple, open source member management system for our makerspace.

It uses a simple json-based database library, TinyDB, to keep track of members and when they've visited. Currently, members are given barcodes to enable login, but we are looking to add RFID support soon.

The core tenets of this application are:

- Free
- Easy to use
- Full featured



The GUI is written in tkinter for ease of quick development and as a learning exercise. Pull requests for new features and improvements are welcome.
